# opensourceleg-umich
The Open Source Robotic Leg is a collaborative, NSF-funded project that spans the University of Michigan, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, and Dephy Inc. With the goal of unifying the research field of prosthetic leg controls, an open source robotic prosthetic leg (OSL) was proposed by the Neurobionics Lab at UM. This OSL is a robust and relatively inexpensive system that can be easily manufactured, assembled, and controlled. Through this website, researchers have access to downloadable hardware and software files so that they can enter the research field without having to design the leg themselves. Ultimately, having a ubiquitous leg will help facilitate comparison between control strategies, potentially streamlining the field towards highly functional robotic prosthetic legs.

Thus, the three main goals of the project are as follows:

* Identify an electromechanical design for a low cost, high performance, open-source robotic knee and ankle system.
* Understand how separate prosthesis control strategies can be combined to benefit amputee gait.
* Evaluate the benefit of resulting controllers in amputee experiments; thereby validating the proposed open-source system as a general tool for research on prosthesis control.
* The project has leveraged the expertise and facilities of Lead PI Rouse at the University of Michigan â€” Ann Arbor, PI Gregg at the University of Texas at Dallas, and PI Geyer at Carnegie Mellon University.
